        <h1 class="subpage-header">Upbringing</h1>
        <h3 class="subpage-text">Soujiro is a brutally effective killer and shows no emotion while carrying out the act except a chillingly heartless smile. He hides his emotions, but has a strong emotional side hidden beneath the smooth exterior that appears when reminded of his past or emotions that he lost (such as love, affection, tenderness).<br><br>
    
            He is extremely talented and extremely smart, picking up signals, cues, and techniques rapidly in order to survive. Survival was his main goal before he became a wandering rurouni.<br><br>
            
            While presenting a strong front to the world, he is really heartbroken on the inside. He still flashes back to his relativesâ€™ physical and emotional abuse. This hardens him when he thinks about loving or being loyal to someone, save for Shishio, who saved him from that awful life.<br><br>
