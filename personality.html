        <h1 class="subpage-header">Personality</h1>
        <h3 class="subpage-text">Soujiro conceals most of his true feelings with a smile. Presenting an outwardly polite and pleasant persona, he has endeavored to conceal the trauma from his abusive childhood as an illegitimate child of a merchant for more than a decade.<br><br>
    
            He is a diligent, hardworking person who does his best to master whatever he must in the moment. Whether this was mastering the Shukuchi by wielding Battoujutsu at high speeds or inventing the Shuntensatsu to instantly kill enemies, Soujiro puts his all into fighting.<br><br>
            
            In fact, Soujiro is not the innocent facade he presents himself to other people. He secretly has a cynical side with subtle sarcasm that he hides beneath good manners. It is hard for most people to pick up on this underhanded tone, unless they are as shrewd as him or unless he is making something explicitly clear.<br><br>
            
            He became extremely perceptive of his environment from his time as an assassin, it is hard to hide changes in mood, tone, or physical surroundings from him. He reads the situation perfectly accurately.<br><br>
            
            When approaching someone, he will be fairly indirect in his speech. He will try to gain their favor and if that doesn’t work, he will usually threaten them in a subtle, underhanded way. Soujiro communicates very subtly, so there are a lot of crucial details that may be lost, but he will make sure you know what he wants you to know very clearly.<br><br>
            
            His cover is deceptive, but he is surely no fool. Living the rough life that he’s lived as an assassin, he knows how to defend himself and is vigorously vigilant. There is a side of him that is sly, cunning, and manipulative which he adapted to survive.<br><br>
            
            Underneath his role as an assassin, Soujiro is still a good person at heart. His heart was broken by a cruel world that did not show him as much love, compassion, or mercy as it should have. When with people he trusts, he is reserved, selfless, and affectionate.<br><br>
