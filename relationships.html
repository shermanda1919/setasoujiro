        <h1 class="subpage-header">Relationships</h1>
        <h3 class="subpage-text">Being abused at the hands of his relatives and treated as a young adult while growing up, Soujiro is not used to children. Their innocence comes across as off putting to someone who has learned the hard lesson that the strong hurt the weak. He tends to distance himself from them and would rather not think of his painful childhood.<br><br>
    
            When approaching someone, he will be fairly indirect in his speech. He will try to gain their favor and if that doesn’t work, he will usually threaten them in a subtle, underhanded way. Soujiro communicates very subtly, so there are a lot of crucial details that may be lost, but he will make sure you know what he wants you to know very clearly.<br><br>
            
            His cover is deceptive, but he is surely no fool. Living the rough life that he’s lived as an assassin, he knows how to defend himself and is vigorously vigilant. There is a side of him that is sly, cunning, and manipulative which he adapted to survive.<br><br>
            
            Soujiro is quietly possessive of the people that he treasures. After losing so much: his mother, his innocence, and his trust in people, he gave up on faith in anything but survival. His shrewdness appears when he wants to cut deals in order to save a mission or one of his loved ones. Rarely does he make a social faux-pas, but by the time people notice it, he has smoothly covered it up with a cover.<br><br>
            
            Underneath his role as an assassin, Soujiro is still a good person at heart. His heart was broken by a cruel world that did not show him as much love, compassion, or mercy as it should have. When with people he trusts, he is reserved, selfless, and affectionate. <br><br>

            His love language is giving gifts. He buys gifts that are practical yet elegant. He always gives to others high quality things. He treasures the ones that he loves and silently takes care of the little things for them under their noses, such as tidying up the room or cooking the meal.<br><br>
