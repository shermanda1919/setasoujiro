        <h1 class="subpage-header">Beliefs</h1>
        <h3 class="subpage-text">Before he was defeated by Himura, he believed that there is no good or evil, only power. After his emotional breakdown which brought up his suppressed trauma, he longs to discover the truth about life after being defeated by Himura: if it is really so bad to be weak, and what the role of the strong is in relation to the weak (to oppress/protect them). That is why he committed to wandering for five years.<br><br>
    
            Like most swordsmen, Soujiro admires people with a strong will and unyielding beliefs. He places faith in the will to power, which will not fail him even when other people have.<br><br>
            
            Despite appearing modest, he has his own pride and honor as one of Japanâ€™s best swordsmen. He values his personal dignity strongly. So being poor has affected his pride as a wanderer, but he uses his resourcefulness to get around financial limitations.<br><br>
            
            He is naive when it comes to intention too because he spent so much of his life living by one philosophy. After wandering as a rurouni, he meets many different people and gradually realizes with the help of others that there is such a thing as purity and goodness in this world. He realizes that he is worthy to be loved.<br><br>
